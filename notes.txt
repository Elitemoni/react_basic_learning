================================================================================
React applications are built around components, a piece of the ui

These components should be modular (combine, breakoff easily)

For each js file, have a corresponding css file to decorate it.
(unless a small project, in that case use one css file for everything)

Twitter Example:
You have a feed component,
which has a tweet component,
which has a like and share component

JS classes here should have a state variable and a render method
   State holds the data to be rendered, 
   Render makes a react element, like a virtual DOM element 
   (idea is we keep this in memory whenver needed)
   We actually call this a virtual DOM

Virtual DOMs are more efficient to change than Real DOMS, idea
is we want to sync up changes with virtual DOM to Real DOM

It's called React because when we change the state, the render()
should automatically update what it looks like in the browser

example component
class Tweet {
   state = {};
   render() {

   }
}

Using a css file for each js file has nothing much to do with scoping,
it's mostly organization
